# Twitter Data Analysis with Ntscrapper

Twitter Data Analysis with Ntscrapper is a project that delves into the world of tweets, uncovering trends, sentiments, and patterns. With Ntscrapper, we explore, clean, and preprocess the data, decoding the language of tweets to extract valuable insights for informed decision-making.

## Features

- Utilizes Ntscrapper for Twitter data analysis
- Explores trends, sentiments, and patterns in tweets
- Cleans and preprocesses tweet data for analysis
- Extracts valuable insights for decision-making

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Ntscrapper
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/twitter-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Navigate to the location of your `Data_Analysis.ipynb` file and click on it to open it.

You can now run the code cells in the notebook by pressing Shift + Enter.

If you specifically want to run the code in the notebook using Python outside of Jupyter Notebook, you can convert the notebook to a Python script using the following command:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script Data_Analysis.ipynb
```

This will create a `.py` file that you can then run using the `python` command. However, note that some functionalities of Jupyter Notebook, such as interactive widgets, may not work in a regular Python script.


3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python Data_Analysis.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Explore the trends, sentiments, and patterns in the tweets.
3. Clean and preprocess the tweet data for analysis.
4. Extract valuable insights for informed decision-making.
